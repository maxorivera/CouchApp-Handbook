# The CouchApp Handbook

## Motivation

The CouchApp Handbook is an attempt to provide a simple
guide for web developers with little or no CouchDB experience
and to provide some "best practice" for developers who are 
more comfortable with developing applications against CouchDB.

Initial goals are to:

 - Lower the barrier-to-entry for new CouchApp developers
 - Clarify the current state of the CouchApp ecosystem
  - Including a basic guide to current tools and frameworks

The idea is to bring together information that is currently
spread over various resources (wikis, mailing lists,
peoples' heads, etc) and present it in a way that is understandable
to a typical web developer.
